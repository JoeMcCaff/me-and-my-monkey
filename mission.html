		<h3> Our Mission </h3>
		<p align="justify">
		Between 2020 and 2021 the governments of Ireland and Northern Ireland began a consultation on a review of the whole island's rail network.
		In 2023, the first draft of the 'All-Island Strategic Rail Review' was released. It included the rebuilding of old lines and the construction of new lines. While many things included in the draft were good, mainly the Letterkenny-Derry-Portadown railway line, it fell flat when it came to solving the infrastructural imbalance in the northwest. Letterkenny would be the only major town in Donegal served, the Western Rail Corridor from Athenry-Collooney would only go far north as Claremorris, and Fermanagh was completely left out.
		</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Our primary focus on rail is getting the governments to build the Letterkenny-Derry-Portadown line, and to do it as soon as possible. It would be by far the most beneficial link to people in north-east Donegal, Derry City, Strabane, Omagh, Dungannon and Portadown. It would allow people from Belfast and Dublin to travel to Letterkenny by train, and would completely change the northwest's economy. No other project in the country would be as transformative as this.
		Our secondary focus is completeing the Western Rail Corridor (WRC) from Claremorris-Collooney, facilitating Galway-Sligo rail service. From there, the 'WRC' would continue from a new connection at Colloney going north to Bundoran, Ballyshannon, Donegal Town, Ballybofey & Stranorlar, and finally Letterkenny. A Sligo-Derry service would allow people to travel right up the spine of County Donegal.
